A paint app that's simple and powerful designed to run as part of a browser hence platform independent .

Note:
a.The Eraser tab needs some debugging after using it you can't use other buttons ,you need to refresh the page.

b.You only need to hover over the button once ,click is not required.

c.The thickness and colour change algorithms are so adjusted that every time you hover on them they will change for four time and after that reset to initial value.

d.Clear Screen works perfectly fine as a replacement to Eraser.

e.Moving your mouse too fast doesn't give a continous line.
